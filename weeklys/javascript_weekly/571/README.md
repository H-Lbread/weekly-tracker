Now it’s on the Web. And I’m still terrible at it. [Here's the JS source.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118249/web)  
  
As an aside, Jordan Mechner (the creator of Prince of Persia) wrote a fantastic [book about the creation of the game](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/118248/web) that I hugely enjoyed a few years ago. It's well worth a read if the diaries of a game developer sound at all interesting to you.
