[JavaScript Developer Breaks Two Popular npm Packages](https://nodeweekly.com/link/118370/web "www.theregister.com") — The creator of Faker.js and colors.js, two packages we’ve mentioned quite often, made some _unorthodox_ commits to his projects recently that caused them to either disappear or [break](https://nodeweekly.com/link/118371/web) in interesting ways which resulted in GitHub [suspending his access](https://nodeweekly.com/link/118372/web) at one point. To be blunt, you want to be finding alternatives. _The Register’s_ writeup is, perhaps, one of the more _colorful._ Dependencies continue to [be risky](https://nodeweekly.com/link/118373/web) and this story will surely trundle on.

[What npm Should Do Today to Stop a New Colors Attack Tomorrow](https://nodeweekly.com/link/118380/web "research.swtch.com") — _“A misfeature in NPM’s design means that as soon as the sabotaged version of colors was published, fresh installs of command-line tools depending on colors immediately started using it, with no testing that it was in any way compatible with each tool. (Spoiler alert: it wasn’t!)”_ — Russ explains how Go’s approach could avert such an issue.
